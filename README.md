# Single Point of Failure Graph
A single point of failure in a network is a part of s system, that if it fails,   
will break the entire flow of that system. 

This program takes in a file of node pairs which symbolises a network.  
By depicting the network as a graph, the program identifies which node in the network is the point of failure.   

_Program Input_  

The program takes multiple strings of integers representing nodes in the network.    
Each node is separated by a space and each network ends with a 0.   
Here is a sample network: 
  
`1 2`     
`5 4`   
`3 1`    
`3 2`  
`3 4`  
`3 5`   
`0`   

You can view the input text in the sample_input.txt file.
